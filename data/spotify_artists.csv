Bruno Mars,"15x time GRAMMY Award winner Bruno Mars is one of the best-selling artists of all time. DOO-WOPS & HOOLIGANS marked the landmark debut of a remarkable new artist. The album – which peaked at #3 on the Billboard 200 – has gone on to achieve global album equivalent sales of 15.5 million. Now boasting more than 7.8 billion total streams, DOO-WOPS & HOOLIGANS is certified RIAA 6X platinum, the longest-charting debut album on Top 200 and #4 longest-running of all time. His most recent album, the critically acclaimed, 3x platinum-certified 24K MAGIC, made an impressive debut atop Billboard’s “Top Digital Albums” and “Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums” charts upon its 2016 arrival. The album includes the 7x platinum-certified, #1 single, “That’s What I Like” – Mars’ seventh “Hot 100” chart-topper and first-ever #1 on the “Hot R&B Songs” chart, affirming him as one of the few artists to have written and produced each of his #1 hits as well as to have a #1 song on the “Hot 100” from each of his first three studio albums. Among his truly countless accolades, Mars is a 4x Guinness World Record holder, with his milestone 2015 NFL Super Bowl Halftime Show drawing a record-breaking total viewership of over 115.3 million. Mars also holds the world record as the “First Male Artist to Achieve Three 10 Million Selling Singles”, while 2016’s 2x GRAMMY® Award-winning, worldwide #1 collaboration with Mark Ronson, “Uptown Funk,” made history for the “Most Weeks at #1 on the U.S. Digital Song Sales” chart.",bruno_mars@prosolutions.com,https://i.scdn.co/image/ab6761610000e5ebc36dd9eb55fb0db4911f25dd,https://open.spotify.com/artist/0du5cEVh5yTK9QJze8zA0C,spotify:artist:0du5cEVh5yTK9QJze8zA0C
2Pac,"A natural ability to appeal to hedonists and revolutionaries alike, combined with charismatic star power and unapologetic threat, made 2Pac one of the most fascinating and successful rappers of the '90s. These qualities, along with his oft-imitated but never replicated flow, have made him an enduring influence on hip-hop decades after his tragic death. 2Pac emerged in 1991 as an ancillary member of , appearing on the group's Top Ten R&B/hip-hop single ""Same Song,"" and by the end of the year earned a reputation as a firebrand with his acclaimed solo debut, 2Pacalypse Now. This was followed at the top of 1992 with a star-making performance in the crime thriller Juice, his first of many major acting roles. In only a few more years, 2Pac racked up a slew of varied Top 20 pop hits, from ""I Get Around"" and ""Keep Ya Head Up"" to ""Dear Mama"" and the chart-topping ""California Love,"" and put together a concurrent streak of platinum full-lengths, namely Strictly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z. (1993), Me Against the World (1995), and All Eyez on Me (1996). Even considering the turbulent life he led, his murder in September 1996 came as a shock. 2Pac's legacy has grown exponentially with help from over a half-dozen Top Ten posthumous releases, an induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame (2017), and the Emmy-nominated documentary miniseries Dear Mama (2023).",2pac@eliteinsights.org,https://i.scdn.co/image/ab6761610000e5eb7f5cc432c9c109248ebec1ac,https://open.spotify.com/artist/1ZwdS5xdxEREPySFridCfh,spotify:artist:1ZwdS5xdxEREPySFridCfh
